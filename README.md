This repository contains a single file implementation of a 'getline'
implementation in F#.

The original version is [getline.cs][1] by Miguel de Icaza as described
in his blog post [getline.cs: Partying like its 1988][2].

The version in this repository was created as an exercise of porting C#
code to F# and making it more functional.

All bugs are mine.
