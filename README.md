[![AppVeyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4471x0562ck3n71h/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vbfox/fsgetline/branch/master)
[![Travis-CI Build status](https://travis-ci.org/vbfox/FsGetLine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vbfox/FsGetLine)
This repository contains an implementation of 'getline' in F#.

The original version is [getline.cs][1] by Miguel de Icaza as described
in his blog post [getline.cs: Partying like its 1988][2].

The version in this repository was created as an exercise of porting C#
code to F# and making it more functional.

All bugs are mine.
